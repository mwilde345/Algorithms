  <h3 class="panel-heading">11. When you look at the number of elements in the
    group of units mod n, do you notice any patterns?  In particular, what
    happens when n is prime?  What happens when n is the product of two primes?
</h3>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <h3></h3>
    <h3>When N is prime, it has n-1 numbers in the group of units.</h3>
    <h3>A product of two primes has x numbers in the group of units where x is
      the product of the sizes of each of those numbers' group of units.</h3>
