  <h3 class="panel-heading">12. Write a method called “toBigIntBlocks” which takes the ArrayList of String blocks from ex. 10 and converts each block to a 600 digit String block using your code from ex. 11.  Check that the length of these Strings is exactly 600. Use these new Strings to create corresponding BigIntegers which are stored in an ArrayList of BigIntegers.  This is your plain text for the input file.  Test it on a file with more than one block.
