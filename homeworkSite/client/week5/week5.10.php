  <h3 class="panel-heading">10. Write a method called “toStringBlocks” which takes a string as input and parses it into 200 character substrings (when possible) which it stores in an ArrayList of Strings.  The last substring is likely to have a length less than 200.  Check the length of each substring to verify it is equal to 200, except possibly the last one, which may be less than 200 (fill this with some default character)  Test it on any text file with more than one block.
